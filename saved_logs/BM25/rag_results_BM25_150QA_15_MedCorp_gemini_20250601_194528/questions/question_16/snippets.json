        "content": "A 21-year-old Thai man presented with progressive weakness and atrophy of both hands for 2 years. His left leg was atrophic and weak secondary to poliomyelitis since he was 8 months old. Physical examination showed that there was atrophy of both hands and forearms as well as left leg. Sensation was normal. Deep tendon reflexes were normal except for hyporeflexia of left leg. EMG showed chronic denervation pattern in the recent atrophic muscles and in normal power muscles. Motor and sensory nerve conductions were normal. Biopsy of forearm muscle revealed degeneration and fibrosis of muscle fibers. These findings were compatible with post-polio syndrome (PPS) which presents in patients with late paralysis following poliomyelitis. It is not a form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis although some clinical similarities exist. Weakness from PPS may lead to musculoskeletal pain and increased functional disability. Proper rehabilitation program is to maintain his functional status and allow him to continue to live as independently as possible by regular exercise without stressing joints and muscles.",

        "content": "The protrusion of cervical intervertebral discs was divided into three pathological entities by Spurling; soft disc, hard disc and spondylosis. We applied these concept to the dorsal intervertebral disc disease and treated two cases of thoracic spondylosis. Case 1. A 41-year-old male entered the hospital because of the gradual progression of weakness of both legs of two months' duration. Since ten days before admission he had not had an errection and had not been to able to walk and micturate. He also complained of paresthesia radiating down the abdomen into both legs. There were no visceral complaints. Neurological examination revealed severe weakness of both legs with bilateral impairment of deep sensations and hypalgesia up to the level of T6. Reflexes in both legs were hyperactive with sustained clonus. Plantar responses were extensor bilaterally. Though plain X-rays showed no changes, tomography revealed a calcified intervertebral spur formation at the T5-6 interspace. A myelogram showed a complete block of the contrast medium at the level of the upper part of T6. The patient underwent a complete laminectomy from T3 through T6 and extradural anterior decompression with the removal of the calcified disc at the T5-6 interspace using an air drill. Postoperatively, he demonstrated an immediate improvement in sensation and a gradual recovery in motor power. At his follow-up examination 14 months after surgery he could walk without assistance. Case 2. A 47-year-old dwarfish woman (130 cm) with a low back pain and difficulty in walking for a few years duration was admitted. A few months before admission she felt pain at her left lateral abdomen. There was weakness of both legs, greater in the left. Reflexes in her left lower extremity were hyperactive with sustained clonus. Plantar responces were flexor bilaterally. Palin X-rays showed scoliosis of thoracic spine with the top at T7 level and calcified intervertebral masses at T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1, extending into the canal that were confirmed more clearly by tomography. Myelography by a cisternal puncture disclosed a complete block at the level of T10. The patient underwent total laminectomy of T9 through L2 and extradural anterior decompression with the removal of calcified discs. At her follow-up examination 12 months after surgery she could walk for herself with some residual neurological signs, minimal weakness in the right leg and hypesthesia up to the level of T12 in the left.

        "content": "Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease are based on the part of the body that is affected. About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms. The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication, which causes pain and severe cramping when walking or exercising. The pain is usually located in the calf muscles of the affected leg and relieved by rest. This occurs because during exercise the muscles of the leg need more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised leg. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen by the muscles, as a result, the leg muscles are overly saturated with lactic acid, resulting in pain of the muscle that only goes away with rest. Other symptoms may include",

        "content": "A 69-year-old male, who had been found (during a routine roentgenogram of the chest at an annual check-up) to have cardiomegaly, had been asymptomatic until 63 years of age, when DOE and swelling of the legs appeared. He visited our hospital because these symptoms has become more severe. Physical examination revealed JVD, third heart sound and a grade 3 holosystolic murmur, hepatomegaly and edema in the lower legs. His ECG showed atrial fibrillation. His chest X-P showed marked cardiomegaly and rt pleural effusion. His echocardiography and MRI revealed a marked enlargement of the right atrium and a slight enlargement of the right ventricle. The latter also showed persistent left superior vena cava. The cardiac catheterization, angiocardiography and intracavitary electrocardiography revealed no organic cardiac disease which induced enlargement of the right atrium. The idiopathic enlargement of the right atrium is a rare disease. Patients suffering from this disease are asymptomatic in most cases. We reported the idiopathic enlargement of the right atrium with persistent left superior vena cava in this paper.",

        "title": "[A case of heterozygous protein C deficiency associated with nephrotic syndrome and deep femoral artery thrombosis].",
        "content": "A 54-year-old male patient with heterozygous Protein C deficiency associated with the nephrotic syndrome and deep femoral artery thrombosis is described. He was admitted to the hospital because of nephrotic syndrome. A few days later, severe pain appeared in his left leg and a diagnosis of deep femoral artery thrombosis was made. Thrombectomy was performed immediately. His proteinuria disappeared in response to corticosteroid. He was found to have Protein C deficiency, antigen: 44%, activity 31%, which was also present in his father and son. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed the obstruction of left internal iliac and deep femoral arteries at their origins. Renal and hepatic biopsy revealed minor glomerular abnormalities, and chronic active hepatitis. The presence of heterozygous Protein C deficiency, nephrotic syndrome and chronic active hepatitis seem to cause marked decrease in serum Protein C level and deep femoral artery thrombosis. He is now under successful control with warfarin (1.7 mg/day) and bucolome (300 mg/day). It was reported that Protein C might have a suppressive effect on hypercoagulability in nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, Protein C deficiency may not counteract the hypercoagulable state and promote thrombus formation in the case. The present report is the first of a case of Protein C deficiency associated with nephrotic syndrome and arterial thrombosis.",

        "content": "A successful surgical case of concomitant aorto-coronary bypass grafting and aorto-right iliac, left femoral bypass grafting was presented. A sixty-two years old male admitted to our institution with complaints of angina pectoris and intermittent claudication of both legs who had a history of acute inferior myocardial infarction for which emergency percutaneous coronary balloon dilatation was carried out prior to this admission. In this admission, he was found out to have diabetes mellitus moreover and he hoped to have one staged operation for two different type of the disease. After general anesthesia, at first, aorto-right coronary bypass grafting with saphenous vein graft was carried out under cardio-pulmonary bypass, then aorto-right iliac, left femoral bypass grafting with a dacron bifurcated graft was made only with one time of systemic heparinization. His postoperative course was uneventful and discharged in good condition. We conclude that simultaneous aorto-coronary bypass and revascularization of both legs can be done with minimal risk.",

        "content": "A 43-year-old man began to notice progressive tingling sensation in his legs and unsteadiness in walking in 1983. His symptoms diminished with prednisolone treatment. In 1986, the same symptoms developed again and abated with prednisolone and plasmapheresis. In 1988 he was admitted because of progression of the symptoms in the legs. Neurological examinations showed mild muscle atrophy and weakness in the legs, loss of the deep reflexes, and impairment of cutaneous and deep sensation of the extremities. Heel-knee test was unsteady, and his gait was wide-based. In addition, Babinski and Chaddock signs were positive bilaterally. He had spontaneous myoclonic jerks of his legs, so-called \"tonic triple flexion\". These jerks were particularly evident during sleep, and were considered to be \"nocturnal myoclonus\". The same jerks were provoked by painful stimuli or Babinski's, Marie-Foix's maneuver. These jerks were considered to be so-called \"spinal automatism\" of spinal or brainstem origin. The latencies of VEP on both sides were prolonged and ABR showed abnormalities indicative of brainstem lesion. There were no abnormalities in cranial and spinal MRI. Our case was proven to have central nervus system lesions in addition to findings of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.",
