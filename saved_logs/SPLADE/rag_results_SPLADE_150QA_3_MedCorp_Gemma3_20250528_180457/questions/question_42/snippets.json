        "content": "Physical Examination Examination usually reveals a prominent RV impulse and palpable pulmonary artery pulsation. The first heart sound is normal or split, with accentuation of the tricuspid valve closure sound. Increased flow across the pulmonic valve is responsible for a midsystolic pulmonary outflow murmur. The second heart sound is widely split and is fixed in relation to respiration. A mid-diastolic rumbling murmur, loudest at the fourth intercostal space and along the left sternal border, reflects increased flow across the tricuspid valve. In ostium primum ASD, an apical holosystolic murmur indicates associated mitral or tricuspid regurgitation or a ventricular septal defect (VSD). FIGURE 282-1 Types and locations of congenital cardiac defects. ASD, atrial septal defect; PDA, patent ductus arteriosus; RMPV, right middle pulmonary vein; RUPV, right upper pulmonary vein; VSD, ventricular septal defect.",

        "title": "Neonatal Lupus Erythematosus -- History and Physical -- Cardiac Manifestations",
        "content": "Newborns with neonatal lupus erythematosus usually have a structurally normal heart. The classic and distinctive cardiac manifestation is a congenital atrioventricular block that can present as first, second, and especially third-degree AV block. Commonly presents between 18 to 24 weeks of gestation. Other cardiac manifestations include sinus bradycardia, QT-interval prolongation, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, myocarditis and structural or valvular abnormalities (ventricular septal defects, ostium secundum type atrial septal defects, patent foramen ovale, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary valve dysplasia, fusion of the chordae tendineae of the tricuspid valve). Second- and third-degree AV block present in utero with fetal bradycardia, with a ventricular rate between 40 and 80 per minute. Postnatally the heart rate is found to be less than 100 per minute, rarely associated with signs of congestive heart failure (diaphoresis, pallor, peripheral edema, prominent jugular veins and crackles on auscultation of the lungs). On cardiac auscultation, there can be an appreciation of nonspecific signs such as intermittent gallops, variability with the intensity of the first heart sound, intermittent cannon waves, and murmurs. Five percent to 10% of infants present with a severe AV block that precipitates myocardial dysfunction due to endocardial fibroelastosis and myocardial fibrosis, associated with right ventricular pacing and subsequent ventricular asynchrony and dysfunction.

        "content": "We examined anatomically the hearts, lungs, and great vessels of 269 WKY/NCrj rats at three fetal and three neonatal stages. Severe pulmonary valve thickening was present in 16 and ventricular septal defects with overriding of the aorta in 15 of the 90 near-term fetuses and in 10 and nine, respectively, of the 79 neonates at 2-4 d of age. These abnormalities occurred together (tetralogy of Fallot) in seven of the near-term fetuses and in five of the neonates. A narrow pulmonary outflow tract was present in 55% of the fetuses and in 56% of the neonates. The wall of the pulmonary arterial branch was abnormally thick in 19% of the fetuses and in 26% of the neonates, most of which did not have septal defects. In about 80% of the fetuses, the middle latitudinal muscle bundle of the ventricular septum was not continuous with the left ventricular free wall, but rather with the right; after birth, it was discontinuous with both free walls. The heart was abnormally heavy in 49% of the 79 neonates. In about half of the heavy hearts, there were no septal defects or pulmonary valvular and arterial lesions. There were double aortic arches in four and right aortic arches in six of the total WKY fetuses and neonates; the ductus arteriosus was abnormally small in 47% and the aorta was large in 51% of the near-term fetuses. This constellation of congenital heart disease is genetic in origin, but altered by hemodynamics late in fetal life.",
