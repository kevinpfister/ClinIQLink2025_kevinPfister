Document 1 (Title: [Long-term nasogastric feeding and complications of acute gastric ulcer in two elderly patients].): Some elderly patients with chronic illness such as stroke, or Parkinsonism cannot take food orally because of dysphagia. In such cases, tube feeding can be used as a supplement to oral intake when malnutrition is present. This route allows for easier nursing care and decreases the frequency of aspiration pneumonia. Complications of tube feeding include nutrient deficiency states, pulmonary aspiration, gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders. We report two cases with complications of acute gastric ulcer which was thought to be induced with long-term tube feeding. Case 1 was a 61-year-old male patient with Parkinson's disease for ten years. L-DOPA had been administered with good control of his condition. However, his ability to swallow has deteriorated gradually. As he often suffered from aspiration pneumonia, nasogastric tube feeding was performed. After three years of tube feeding, he suddenly vomited much bloody material. He died from massive bleeding with acute gastric dilatation. Autopsy showed giant acute gastric ulcer covered with coagulated blood. UL3, 50 mm in maximum diameter, was observed in the middle portion of the greater curvature, where the top of tube probably came in contact with the gastric wall. Case 2 was an 83-year-old female patient with stroke and chronic heart failure. She had been hospitalized for about one year because of the intermittent deterioration of her cardiac condition. Furthermore, her inability to swallow increased during her hospitalization. She also suffered from aspiration pneumonia. Nasogastric tube feeding was performed to prevent aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. She died of acute heart failure after twelve months. Autopsy revealed heart dilatation, old myocardial infarction and stroke. In addition, two acute gastric ulcers (UL3.10 and 30 mm in diameter) were recognized; one was in the upper portion of the greater curvature, the other in the lower portion of the greater curvature. The location of these gastric ulcers was unusual. Moreover, they coincided with location of top of the nasogastric tube. From these two cases, we conclude that in long-term tube feeding the tip of the tube often comes in contact with the gastric wall, and gastric ulcer could be produced by repeated mechanical stimulus of the wall. Reports of acute gastric ulcer induced by tube feeding have not been published previously. Therefore, we should pay much attention to this complication in the care of the elderly people with long-term tube feeding.
Document 2 (Title: Pennsylvania Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting -- Pearls and Other Issues -- A 13-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician because of a recent decline in her grades. During a private interview, she admits she has "problems with boys at school" and "bad dreams about boys always staring at her." The child privately admits she regularly gets up in the middle of the night and sleeps with the biological mother on her side of the bed, with her stepfather next to her mother. The child indicates the stepfather has commented that she is a "looker," has "big headlights," and needs to "fend off the boys at school." The pediatrician attended high school with the stepfather and knows he is not the "brightest bulb" but seems to care about the child genuinely. The child indicates the stepfather wears pajamas, has never touched her, and always knocks before entering the bathroom or her room. She says she is very anxious about attending school and is afraid to speak with her mother about her school problems. She says her stepfather has always been "very good" to her mother and is always kind and considerate to her as well. She does not want to get him into trouble but feels his comments about her appearance add to her anxiety. What should the pediatrician do in this situation?): Given the totality of the circumstances, there may not be reasonable cause to suspect child abuse; however, there remain numerous concerns, such as the child's problems at school, nightmares, child co-sleeping at the age of 13, and the stepfather's inappropriate comments to the child. General concerns for a child's safety, health, and well-being may be reported to ChildLine for assessment of services and support. The PA CPSL prescribes that a person, hospital, institution, school, facility, agency, or agency employee acting in good faith shall have immunity from civil and criminal liability that might otherwise result from making a report of suspected child abuse or making a referral for general protective services, regardless of whether the report is required to be made under the PA CPSL.
Document 3 (Title: [Child abuse: report of three cases].): Child abuse, a clinical condition in young children who have received serious physical abuse, is a frequent cause of permanent injury or death. The first case is a 7-year-old boy suffering from abdominal distension and pain for 3 days. He was beaten by his mother as a result of inadequately learning his lessons. Sonogram and CT of the abdomen showed massive ascites and a pseudocyst of the pancreatic body about 3 x 3 cm in diameter. The second case is a 4-year-old girl who developed a semicomatose state after her father impulsively struck her with a chair. CT of the brain revealed subdural hematoma over the left fronto-temporal region and midline shift to the right. She expired 5 days later. The third case, a 2-year-old girl, suffered from headache, seizure, vomiting and general malaise. CT of the brain showed severe brain swelling over the right side and midline shift to the left. She expired 1 month later. Psychiatric factors are probably of prime importance in the pathogenesis of the disorder, but our knowledge of these factors is limited. Parents who inflict abuse on children do not necessarily have psychopathic or sociopathic personalities or come from borderline socioeconomic groups, although most published cases fall into one of these categories. It is clearly the responsibility of all physicians serving children to be aware of, to recognize, and to properly manage any child who has been the victim of abuse.
Document 4 (Title: Early mother-infant reciprocity.): By three weeks of age, the human neonate demonstrates behaviours which are quite different with an object and with a human interactant. He also demonstrates an expectancy for interaction with his caregiver which has clearly defined limits, as demonstrated behaviourally. In microanalysis of videotape, we saw regularly a set of interactive behaviours which were demonstrable in optimal face-to-face interaction between infants and their mothers. All parts of the infant's body move in smooth circular patterns as he attends to her. His face-to-face attention to her is rhythmic with approach-withdrawal cycling of extremities. The attention phase and build-up to her cues are followed by turning away and a recovery phase in a rhythm of attention-non-attention which seems to define a cyclical homeostatic curve of attention, averaging several cycles per minute. When she violates his expectancy for rhythmic interaction by presenting a still, unresponsive face to him, he becomes visibly concerned, his movements become jerky, he averts his face, then attempts to draw her into interaction. When repeated attempts fail, he finally withdraws into an attitude of helplessness, face averted, body curled up and motionless. If she returns to her usual interactive responses, he comes alive after an initial puzzled period, and returns to his rhythmic cyclical behaviour which has previously characterized their ongoing face-to-face interaction. This attentional cycling may be diagnostic of optimal mother-infant interactions and seems not to be present in more disturbed interactions.
Document 5 (Title: [Neonatal gastric necrosis].): Neonatal necrotizing gastritis is rare. It is usually a complication of acute anoxia or shock and its diagnosis is essentially radiological. Case no. 1: a boy was born at the 36th week of a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia. Perinatal asphyxia necessitated delivery by cesarean section. He presented with neonatal respiratory distress which was complicated by pneumothorax. On the 5th day of life, the abdomen was distended and the newborn had still not been fed. On the 6th day, X-rays showed pneumatosis of the gastric wall associated with pneumoperitoneum. Surgery showed an area of necrosis on the posterior surface of the stomach with a small perforation, which was stitched. The child was fed 5 days later and was in good condition at the age of 6 months. Case no. 2: a girl was born at the 35th week of a pregnancy complicated by asthma during the second trimester. Perinatal asphyxia and abnormal fetal rhythm led to delivery by cesarean section. At 24 hour of life, she vomited blood and fibroscopy confirmed the presence of blood in the stomach. On the 3rd day, blood vomiting appeared again, associated with abdominal distension. X-rays showed pneumatosis of the gastric wall; fibroscopy showed necrosis of the lower 2/3 of the stomach. Feeding was stopped and the child was given cimetidine. Refeeding was possible when the girl was 10 days old, and she was in good condition at the age of 6 months. Neonatal gastric necroses and necrotizing enterocolitis have many similar features. Medical therapy is often effective, but surgery is mandatory when necrotizing gastritis is complicated by perforation.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color. On physical exam, the child's abdomen is minimally distended but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation?
Options:
A. Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud
B. Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize
C. Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus
D. Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline
