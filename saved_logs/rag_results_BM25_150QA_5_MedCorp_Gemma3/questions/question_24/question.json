She calls the nurse to her room because she says that her heart is racing. She also demands that someone come in to clean the pile of garbage off of the floor because it is attracting flies. Her pulse is 112/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, temperature is 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg.
