== Answer ==
{
    "answer": ["1", "3"]
}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer is incorrect because the activation energy of an enzymatic reaction is the energy needed to activate the substrate, not the enzyme or energy released/retained; the prompt should clarify the definition of activation energy to avoid confusion.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
