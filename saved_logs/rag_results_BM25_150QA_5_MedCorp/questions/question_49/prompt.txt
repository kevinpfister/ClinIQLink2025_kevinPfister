Document 1 (Title: [Chorea associated with antiphospholipid antibodies].): We report a 21-year-old woman in whom chorea was associated with antiphospholipid antibodies. In August 1986, she developed involuntary movement which started in the right hand but subsided spontaneously. In September 1988, she again developed right-sided involuntary movements which started in the right hand but rapidly progressed to involve the whole of the right side. In September 1990, she was admitted to our hospital for investigation of choreiform movements, because her involuntary movements had progressed to involve all four extremities. She had no family or past history of chorea, psychiatric, rheumatological or vascular disease. On admission, she had difficulty in speaking and swallowing due to choreiform movements of her mouth and tongue. Her gait was unsteady. On walking she had wild gyrations of the arms. Choreiform movements of all four extremities, neck, face, mouth and tongue were present at rest, more marked on the right side. There was no other neurological deficits. She had none of the classical features of SLE. She had none of the complications commonly associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) (i.e., recurrent spontaneous abortion, thrombosis and thrombocytopenia). Laboratory tests revealed that antinuclear antibody was present. Cardiolipin antibody (VDRL) was positive but specific tests for syphilis were negative. Anticardiolipin antibodies were present. All coagulation studies have failed to reveal lupus anticoagulant. Brain CT, MRI, 123IMP-SPECT and cerebral angiography were normal. Associated with her chorea, she had the serological but not the clinical features of APS. We suggest that antiphospholipid antibodies should be looked for in all unexplained cases of chorea, even when the associated clinical signs of APS are absent.
Document 2 (Title: [A case of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism with extrapyramidal signs and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus].): A case of a 29-year-old woman with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism was reported. There were neither endocrine nor neurological disorders among her family, except for her mother's hearing loss. She had been suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus since 21 years of age, and was noticed to be hard of hearing for several years, but never been examined. At the age of 27, choreic movement on her left upper limb and gait disturbance appeared. A year before admission, gait disturbance gradually developed and she could not walk any more. On admission, her height was 137.2 cm and her weight 36.5 kg. She had a round face, uneven teeth and borderline metacarpal sign on her right hand. On neurological examination, Parkinsonism, bucco-lingo-masticatory dyskinesia and bilateral extensor planter reflex were present, but tetany was not observed anywhere. Serum calcium was 3.9 mEq/l, and serum phosphorus 5.3 mEq/l. A CT scan of brain revealed calcifications in the bilateral basal ganglia and thalami, low density area in the left putamen, and atrophy of both caudate nuclei. Serum PTH was less than 100 pg/ml. Ellsworth-Howard's test showed hyperresponsiveness in the secretion of urinary phosphorus and cyclic-AMP. Other endocrinological studies showed no abnormality except for hyporesponsiveness in the secretion of insulin on glucose tolerance test. On the basis of these results, a diagnosis of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was made. Administration of alfacalcidol returned serum calcium and phosphorus to normal with considerable clinical benefit. Parkinsonism was gradually improved and she became to be able to walk with a cane after one year of treatment. But buco-lingo-masticatory dyskinesia were not reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: [Reducing body myopathy--a case report].): A 2-year-old girl with reducing body myopathy was reported. She had no family history of neuromuscular disease. She developed normally with no delay in milestones during infancy. She had no muscle weakness or hypotonia up to 2 years of age when she received mumps vaccination. Three days after the injection, she was first noticed to have limb muscle weakness. The muscle weakness progressed rapidly with increasing difficulty in gait and raising the upper arms, particularly the left. Four months later, she had difficulty in keeping her head up and could no longer climb the stairs. On physical examination, she had proximal dominant generalized muscle weakness, with a preferential neck muscle involvement. She walked waddlingly and stood up with Gowers' maneuver. Facial and ocular muscles were intact. No dysarthria, dysphagia or respiratory difficulty was noted. EMG showed myopathic pattern. Serum creatine kinase level was moderately elevated to 739 IU/l. In the biopsied left biceps muscle, there was marked variation in fiber size, but no apparent necrotic or regenerating fibers. The most striking feature was the presence of numerous eosinophilic inclusions which reduced nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and were, therefore, stained dark with menadione-linked alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase even without the substrate of menadione, showing the histochemical characteristics of "reducing" body. The bodies were predominantly seen in fibers with disorganized intermyofibrillar networks and with high acid phosphatase activity. On electron microscopy, the reducing bodies consisted of fine granular material with the similar electron density to the chromatin granules and were located mostly around the degenerated nuclei, suggesting the nuclear degeneration playing a role in forming the reducing bodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 4 (Title: [A case of phenytoin intoxication induced by hypothyroidism].): A 42-year-old woman who presented phenytoin intoxication induced by acute hypothyroidism was reported. She had a 29-year history of hypothyroidism and a 18-year history of epilepsy. She was treated with phenytoin (PHT) 100 mg, mephobarbital (MPB) 200 mg, valproic acid (VPA) 400 mg and thyroid powder 100 mg daily for 2 years. She had no medical problem until she noticed gait disturbance and diplopia which appeared 1 month after sudden withdrawal of thyroid powder. On admission, she was somnolent and somewhat disoriented. She had nystagmus in horizontal direction of gaze. Her speech was slurred and she could not sit nor stand due to trunkal ataxia. There was prominent intentional tremor in finger-nose test and heel-shin test showed severe ataxia. Blood cell count and blood chemistry examinations were normal. Serum PHT, phenobarbital (PB) levels were elevated as to 26.4, 36.4 micrograms/ml, respectively. VPA level was low. The endocrinological examinations revealed primary hypothyroidism. EEG showed generalized slow background, but cranial MRI, EMG, SEP and ECG were normal. Thyroxine (T4) administration was started soon, and in the course of thyroid hormone replacement, her cerebellar symptoms gradually improved and serum PHT level decreased even to the subtherapeutical level with the same amount of antiepileptic drugs treatment. By the 40th day of admission, thyroid function became normal and cerebellar signs disappeared, however, she needed 200 mg PHT daily to obtain good control of epilepsy. Cerebellar symptoms of this patient were thought to be PHT intoxication rather than ataxia caused by hypothyroidism itself from the viewpoint of clinical manifestations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 5 (Title: [Ataxic cerebral palsy and brain imaging].): Five cases diagnosed as having ataxic cerebral palsy were presented with their brain imaging. Case 1, a 3-year-old-girl had been floppy since 7 months of age and began ataxic walk with spastic legs from 18 months of age. MRI revealed generalized atrophy of cerebellum (especially in anterior superior part) and slight atrophy of pons. Her mother also had ataxia with spastic legs of early onset. She and her mother were thought to have an early-onset inherited non-progressive cerebellar ataxia syndrome. Case 2, a 8-year-old-girl had ataxic walk since 17 months of age. MRI revealed cerebellar atrophy especially in anterior superior part. Case 3, a 10-year-old boy was floppy since 4 months of age and suspected as ataxic at 4 years of age. He could walk only with cruches. He had dwarfism and cataracts since 4 years of age. CT and MRI revealed generalized spino-ponto-cerebellar atrophy. Final diagnosis was Marinesco-Sjörgren syndrome. Case 4, a 10-year-old girl had opisthotonus and floppiness since 4 months of age. She could walk only with cruches. CT and MRI revealed generalized spino-ponto-cerebellar atrophy. Case 5, a 8-year-old boy showed head nodding and nystagmus since 4 months of age. He started ataxic gait at 8 years of age. He could vocalize only single sound for speech. MRI revealed cranium bifida and agenesis of anterior medullar velum. Ataxic cerebral palsy is the term often used to describe very different conditions, the clinical picture starts as hypotonia and changes into the ataxic symptoms in a few years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 35-year-old woman with a history of Crohn disease presents for a follow-up appointment. She says that lately, she has started to notice difficulty walking. She says that some of her friends have joked that she appears to be walking as if she was drunk. Past medical history is significant for Crohn disease diagnosed 2 years ago, managed with natalizumab for the past year because her intestinal symptoms have become severe and unresponsive to other therapies. On physical examination, there is gait and limb ataxia present. Strength is 4/5 in the right upper limb. A T1/T2 MRI of the brain is ordered and is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD)
B. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)
C. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)
D. Progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML)
